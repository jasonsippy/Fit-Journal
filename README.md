## Test Description
Fit Journal is a database application that allows the user to log their work outs so they can track their progress. With all 

Fit Journal serves as a commitment to better yourself. Without a plan or journanl, a person can run into a plateau because they haven't payed attention to their progress; instead they are just going through the motions. However, if you monitor your progress, you can make the necessary adjustments to stay ahead of your pervious self. Not only does progress tracking benefit you as you move toward your goal, but also when you look back at it; you can see how far you've come.
